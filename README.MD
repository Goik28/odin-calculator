It was a challenging project even thou I thought that i had prior experience in doing calculators.

the chaining of operations and the possibility of the user doubling the
operation or equal input bested some of my sollutions so I had to use
some flags variables.

Ok, half an hour after the last commit I was seeing the awnsers of other students and decided to cheese the keyboard function. In the end my function is pretty differente, I just use the keypress to "click" the html button, but i have to admit that it would have take longer to do it if I didn't look up.
